# AspNetMvcCRUD

This is an Asp.net mvc project with CRUD operations.
In this application the user can add an employee to the list and also edit and delete the employees if the user wants to.
The Database used for these operations is Microsoft SQL.
I have uploaded an exe file to download and run on your local-host, so that you can take a look at the application.
